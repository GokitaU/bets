Project Description

Please only those who have experience in extracting betting odds apply. This project is for personal use only, therefore aesthetics isn't important. I need an odds comparison data table that contains a database of specific odds from specific bookies. The odds are NBA player points ONLY and the list of bookies is below. You need to extract the odds by scraping or if you have bookie APIs. The data table needs to have: 

name of bookie, 
time of event, (single)
player name, 
number of points, 
odds for over, 
odds for under 
and if possible team of player. (single)

Time of evend and team can be scraped from a single bookie. Output table has to be sortable by several levels. Default sort would be: player name, number of points, odds. 

Of course, the output data table needs to be online so I can refresh the table when needed. Fetching can be manual. 
Below are the bookies that are needed and the best possible link that leads to NBA player points. Some bookies have the same link each day, some create links with event ids daily. I will upload the screenshots of several bookies so that you can easily see which odds are needed.
Note: not all bookies have the same player name structure, so the database needs to match similar expressions.

There are 4 more bookies that need to be fetched however those are already available in a data table done by a freelancer that had to give up before finishing. He gave me links and passwords to data and mysql tables as well as the code, so fetching/scraping them shouldn't be a problem.

IMPORTANT: Please make a quick check if you can scrap/extract odds from the listed bookies before making an offer. Some bookie pages are in Flash. 
Whoever can get me the most bookies in minimum time will be chosen. Thank you. I am available for any questions, please note I am not experienced in databases, web design and web page scraping. Also a possibility of later adding new bookies, new 
features etc.
